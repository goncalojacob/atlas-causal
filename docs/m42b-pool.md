# M42b — the Americas, and Europe before 1900

The second records lane, opened 22 September on the branch `m42b` under
`docs/m42b-brief.md`: M42's brief and its eleven amendments with A11's
partition. **M42 takes Africa and Asia; this run takes the Americas, every
century from 1492, and Europe before 1900.** Deviations number from 1200.

This file is M42's `docs/m42-pool.md` for this lane: the measurement first,
then a section per batch with the main count, the per-lane and per-century
counts, the largest connected component before and after, and what was
refused.

## The measurement, before anything is imported

*22 September, 11:50Z, on `m42b` cut from `origin/m0` at `28978129`. `m42`
stands one batch further on (590 active, 244 main, component 503); nothing of
its batch 34 is here, and the two lanes are measured apart until the assistant
lands them.*

| | |
| --- | --- |
| event records | 819 |
| **active** | **582** |
| **main** (part of no active event) | **245** |
| filed (part of at least one) | 337 |
| active edges | 638 |
| **largest connected component** | **502** |
| components | 59 |
| events with no edge at all | 42 |
| every active event's `review.status` | `draft` |

### Per lane and per century (A10)

Active / main, over the topology the validator builds, so the lanes are the
atlas's own — a record's `region` override first, then the lane its place's
point falls in.

| century | europe | africa | asia | americas | oceania | no lane | all |

### What is this run's, read off that table

**The Americas hold 83 active events against Europe's 303**, and 59 of the 83
are main — the lane is both the thinnest of the four and the least filed, so
nearly every record it has stands alone on the resting timeline.

**Europe before 1900 is thirteen events.** One in the 15th century
(`treaty-of-tordesillas-1494`), one in the 16th
(`hereditary-captaincies-of-brazil-1534`, in Lisbon), one in the 17th
(`royal-african-company`), one in the 18th
(`the-british-industrial-revolution`), and nine in the 19th, of which eight
are main. The brief's *"one to eight main events each"* is exactly what is
here. **Those four cells — Europe's 15th to 18th centuries, one active event
apiece — are the thinnest in the whole atlas**, and the 16th, 17th and 18th
have no umbrella of any kind over them.

**Every pre-1900 record the atlas holds is Atlantic**: the Columbian voyages,
Brazil's cycles of sugar, gold and coffee, the Caribbean sugar islands, the
slave trade and the acts that ended it. There is no continental Europe before
1884 at all, and no North America before 1893.

### South and Central America against North America

The brief orders the `americas` lane *"South and Central America before North
America until they hold as many active events as North America"*. Measured by
the latitude of each event's place, splitting at the Rio Grande's mouth
(25.9°N):

| | active events with a place |
| --- | --- |
| South and Central America, and the Caribbean | **48** |
| North America | **8** |
| in the lane but placeless | 27 |

**The condition the brief sets is already met** — South and Central America
hold six times what North America holds — so the ordering does not bind this
run, and **North America is in fact the thinner half**. The 27 placeless are
mostly South American (Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia) with a handful of
worldwide records that take the lane from an override; A9's place pass is
where they are read.

### What the first batches take, in the order a fire should weigh them

1. **Europe, the 16th century** — one active event, no umbrella.
2. **The Americas, the 16th and 18th centuries** — three each.
3. **Europe, the 17th and 18th centuries** — one each.
4. **The Americas, the 15th and 17th centuries** — four and six, all main.

The main count this run must not raise is **245**, and the component it must
not shrink is **502**.

## Batch 1 — the Italian Wars, and the Greco-Turkish War of 1897

*22 September, the first fire. Taken from the cells that trail most in this
partition: **Europe's 15th to 18th centuries**, one active event apiece and no
umbrella of any kind over the 16th, 17th or 18th; and **Europe's 19th**, where
the atlas held a war with none of its parts.*

**The rule, the same three tests M42's vein uses.** An item enters only if it
is `part of` something this atlas holds or is the umbrella that the cell
lacks; its span must sit inside the parent's at the year; its lane must be
this partition's. Ranked by sitelinks, ties by item id. Nothing was struck or
added by hand except the four refusals below, each for a stated reason.

### What arrived

| the record | sitelinks | filed under | placed at | the edge it earned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `italian-wars` | 50 | — (the umbrella) | placeless (see deviation 1201) | none |
| `italian-war-of-1521-1526` | 31 | `italian-wars` | placeless (P276 is a country) | none |
| `war-of-the-league-of-cambrai` | 30 | `italian-wars` | placeless (see deviation 1201) | none |
| `italian-war-of-1551-1559` | 23 | `italian-wars` | placeless (P276 is a country) | none |
| `italian-wars-of-1499-1504` | 19 | `italian-wars` | placeless (P276 is a country) | none |
| `battle-of-st-quentin` | 17 | **`italian-war-of-1551-1559`** | `saint-quentin` | none |
| `italian-war-of-1536-1538` | 17 | `italian-wars` | `provence` | none |
| `battle-of-domokos` | — | `greco-turkish-war-of-1897` | `domokos` | none |
| `cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898` | — | **refused, see below** | `crete` | it `--caused-->` the war |
| `battle-of-velestino` | — | `greco-turkish-war-of-1897` | `velestino` | none |

Five place records came with them, each from the `P276` the event's own item
names: `provence` and `crete` at `region` precision, `saint-quentin`,
`domokos` and `velestino` at `city`. A sixth, `italian-peninsula`, was
written and then withdrawn — deviation 1201. The precision is read
off the class Wikidata gives the item — town and commune are settlements,
peninsula and region are not — and the import's own `point` was replaced by
it, which is what A9 asks for and what the import does not yet write.

**`battle-of-st-quentin` went to the nearer parent.** Wikidata files it under
the Italian Wars; its own lead calls it *"a decisive engagement of the Italian
War of 1551–1559"*, and that war is now here and contains 1557. A8 says a
parent already reachable through another parent is not a second parent, so it
has the one.

### The edge

`cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898 --caused--> greco-turkish-war-of-1897`,
`probable`, two locators. The war's lead names the cause — *"Its immediate
cause involved the status of the Ottoman province of Crete"* — and the
revolt's article supplies the other half under "Ottoman intervention": *"On
April 17, 1897, the Ottoman Empire officially declared war on Greece."* The
join between the two is made here and not in either article, which is why it
is `probable`; rule 22 would refuse `consensus` on two Wikipedia citations in
any case. It is the batch's one edge into what was already here, and it is
what moved the component.

### What was refused, and why

- **`Q15542964`, "Italian War of 1542–46 Un penesote"** — the item's English
  label carries what reads as vandalism, and the label is what this atlas
  would print as the title. Refused rather than silently tidied: correcting
  somebody else's label is not this run's to do from a sandbox, and inventing
  a title is not either.
- **`Q14905833` Farsala, `Q12880485` Livadeia, `Q16331940` Voukolies,
  `Q130425867` Pente Pigadia** — four battles of 1897 with no English
  Wikipedia article and a description that reads, in full, "1897 battle".
  The brief's own rule: where the import gives nothing usable the record is
  refused, not furnished.
- **Filing `cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898` under the war** — refused twice over.
  Its span (1897–1898) runs a year past the war's end, and its own lead never
  calls it part of the war; it calls it an insurrection against Ottoman rule
  that the Great Powers settled. The relation between them is causal, so it
  was written as an edge and not as a parent.
- **Filing `berlin-conference` under `scramble-for-africa`** — the one hit the
  `part of` pass over this partition's 40 main events with an item returned,
  and it fails at the year: the conference sat from November 1884, and the
  umbrella this atlas holds begins in 1885. The fix would be to widen the
  umbrella from its own cited article under A7, and `scramble-for-africa` is
  an Africa record and so M42's.
- **`Q2599571` "Crete eyalet" as the revolt's place**, in favour of `Q34374`
  Crete. A9 says the first located thing wins and the eyalet is first, but an
  Ottoman eyalet is a polity, and what ground a polity held is a presence in
  this atlas and never a place. Crete the island is the geography, and its
  point is also what corrected the lane: the import had derived `asia` for the
  revolt from the Ottoman Empire's own point.

**Deviation 1200. The main count rose by two and A6 says a batch that does
that has to say why.** The two are `italian-wars` and
`cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898`, and they are different cases.

The umbrella is the first: Europe's 16th century had one active event and
nothing to file anything under, so the century could not be filled at all
without a top-level record to hang it from — the brief asks for exactly that
(*"write the regional period umbrellas a lane or century lacks"*). It is the
cheap direction of the trade and not the dear one: **ten records arrived and
the resting timeline gained two bars, not ten**. Every further record of the
Italian Wars — and the vein has six more rows already measured — now files
under it for nothing.

The revolt is the second and it is not a trade at all: it is a record whose
sources refuse to make it part of anything this atlas holds, so it stands on
the resting picture with an edge and no parent. That is the honest outcome and
it is what `degree-zero` and the main count are for.

**Deviation 1201. `italian-peninsula` was written as a place and withdrawn
before the fire ended.** A9's rule gave it: the Italian Wars' item names the
Italian Peninsula in `P276` and it carries a point, so a `region` place was
written and two records pointed at it. The map then wrote *"Italian
Peninsula"* across Rome — `tests/map-browser.test.mjs` caught it twice, on the
run's own check and here, and it is a real defect and not a flake: a label
placed at 42°N 14°E is a name written over the middle of Italy.

The fix is in the data and not in the placer, because this run may not touch
the display. **A point that stands for a whole country-sized region is the
case A9 itself holds back**: *"until `M80 done` is on `origin/m0`, an event
whose only located thing is its country stays placeless"*, and M80 is the
milestone that adds the `country` precision and the mark that draws a thing
that large. A peninsula the size of Italy is that case in everything but the
word, so the record was deleted, `Q145694` taken back out of the seeds and the
import's `done` list, and `italian-wars` and `war-of-the-league-of-cambrai`
left placeless in the `europe` lane as the import first wrote them. `provence`
and `crete` are the size of a province and an island and stay. **Five places,
not six; five of the ten events placed, not seven.**

**The batch grew the component by one and left nine records with no edge.**
That is the vein's known cost, measured again: the Italian Wars' phases are
chronological to each other and their leads argue no causation between them,
which is the same finding M42's batch 34 wrote down about the Vietnam War. The
umbrella holds them in the picture; nothing was invented to connect them.

## Batch 2 — the Falklands War, filed and placed

*22 September, the second fire. Taken from the **`americas` lane**, which
batch 1 did not touch and which is the larger half of this partition: 83
active events against Europe's 313, and 59 of the 83 standing alone on the
resting timeline. The cell is the 20th century, where the lane held 43 active
events to Europe's 238.*

**Why the Falklands War and not another vein.** The inverse `part of` sweep
over this partition's 49 items with a Wikidata id returned **164 distinct
items, 161 of them new**, and the largest veins in it are
`colombian-conflict` (41), `falklands-war` (39),
`charter-of-the-united-nations` (25), `cuban-revolution` (16),
`great-depression` (13) and `la-violencia` (10). The Falklands vein was taken
first because **every row of it is dated inside 1982 and the umbrella this
atlas holds is dated 1982**: nothing had to be widened, nothing had to be
refused at the year, and the main count could not move. The Cuban Revolution's
vein was left where it is for the opposite reason — this atlas dates
`cuban-revolution` at 1959 and its battles run from 1953, so taking it means
widening the umbrella under A7 first, and `great-depression` and
`la-violencia` are both on A12's list of spans M42 is re-reading, which is
M42's pass and not this branch's.

### What arrived

Twenty-two events, every one filed under `falklands-war` and every one placed.

| the record | filed under | placed at | precision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operation-rosary` | `falklands-war` | `stanley` | city |
| `invasion-of-south-georgia` | `falklands-war` | `grytviken` | city |
| `operation-algeciras` | `falklands-war` | `bay-of-gibraltar` | point |
| `operation-paraquet` | `falklands-war` | `south-georgia` | region |

| `mount-kent-skirmish` | `falklands-war` | `mount-kent` | point |
| `skirmish-at-top-malo-house` | `falklands-war` | `mount-simon` | point |

| `battle-of-mount-harriet` | `falklands-war` | `falkland-islands` | region |
| `battle-of-mount-tumbledown` | `falklands-war` | `falkland-islands` | region |
| `battle-of-wireless-ridge` | `falklands-war` | `falkland-islands` | region |
| `operation-keyhole` | `falklands-war` | `thule-island` | region |

### Places (A9)

**Fourteen place records, every one from the first located thing its event's
item names that carries a `P625`** — `P276` in every case here, so the fallback
to `P131` and `P17` was never reached. Seven events took the archipelago
because Wikidata gives their item no location narrower than it: the four ridge
battles above Port Stanley are named hills with their own items, but no item
points its `P276` at them, and **A9 forbids inventing the point that would
place them**.

| precision | places | read off the class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `city` | `stanley`, `goose-green`, `grytviken` | capital city, human settlement, whaling station — settlements |
| `point` | `bay-of-gibraltar`, `san-carlos-water`, `mount-kent`, `mount-simon`, `mount-longdon`, `pleasant-peak` | bay, mountain, hill — a site and not an area |
| `region` | `falkland-islands`, `south-georgia`, `west-falkland`, `pebble-island`, `thule-island` | island and archipelago — larger than a settlement and not a state |

No place took the `country` precision, although **`M80 done` is now on
`origin/m0`** and the precision is available for the first time — nothing in
this batch resolved to a state.

`falkland-islands` is the one that had to be weighed against deviation 1201.
Its item is a territory as well as an archipelago (`Q46395` British Overseas
Territory), and batch 1 refused the Crete eyalet for being a polity. It is
written here as a place all the same, at `region`, because what these battles
need is the island group and that is what the item's own point and description
give: *"archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean"*. It is 250 km across — the
size of Crete, which batch 1 kept, and not the size of the Italian peninsula,
which it withdrew.

**Three places are outside every lane polygon** and carry a hand-written
`region` with the note rule 10 asks for: `grytviken`, `south-georgia` and
`thule-island` sit at 54°S and 59°S, below every region outline the atlas
draws. They take the `americas` lane, which is the lane the Falklands
themselves are in.

### The edges (A5, M72)

Four, each from what an article states in so many words, each `probable` —
rule 22 refuses `consensus` on a Wikipedia citation and none of these joins is
written whole in one source. **Two of the four run into records the atlas
already held**, which is what A5 asks a batch for.

| the edge | into what existed | what the source says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operation-rosary --caused--> falklands-war` | yes | *"The invasion served as a catalyst for the subsequent Falklands War."* |
| `battle-of-mount-tumbledown --caused--> argentine-surrender-in-the-falklands-war` | yes | *"…leading to the fall of Stanley and the surrender of Argentine forces on the islands."* |
| `invasion-of-south-georgia --caused--> operation-paraquet` | within the batch | the seizure of 3 April and the operation *"to recapture the island of South Georgia from Argentine military control"* |
| `operation-sutton --enabled--> battle-of-goose-green` | within the batch | Goose Green was *"within striking distance of San Carlos Water, where the British task force had positioned themselves after their amphibious landing"* |

`operation-rosary --caused--> falklands-war` is an edge from a part to its own
umbrella, and it is written on purpose: `parent` is a display fact that never
enters the adjacency, so the argument that the landing of 2 April set off what
followed has to be carried by the graph or not at all.

### What was refused, and why

- **`operation-sutton --precondition-of--> battle-of-san-carlos`, written and
  then deleted.** Rule 4 caught it: the landing ran 21–23 May and the air
  battle over the anchorage ran 21–25 May, so neither precedes the other. They
  are the same five days seen from the beach and from the air, and the arrow of
  time is right to refuse it.
- **`Q7164` the World Bank and `Q7804` the IMF**, the two largest rows of the
  whole sweep. They are `part of` the Bretton Woods system and they are
  institutions, not events; an actor is what they would be here, and this batch
  is an events batch.
- **`Q155801` FARC**, the largest row of the Colombian vein, for the same
  reason.
- **The twenty-five chapters and preambles of the UN Charter.** A chapter of a
  treaty is a division of a text, not an event, and not one of them carries a
  date.
- **Nine Falklands items with an article in one or two languages and no
  usable span**: two duplicate items for the sinking of HMS Sheffield
  (`Q59559767`, `Q68972231`), `Q68995930` the contested attack on HMS
  Invincible, `Q86083723`, `Q91168260`, `Q84762353`, `Q96638398`,
  `Q19597807` and `Q59640621`. The three "theater of war" items
  (`Q64918028`, `Q64918147`, `Q64995751`) are scopes and not events;
  `Q7097290` Operation Mikado was never executed and carries no date;
  `Q126478242` is an "aspect of history" and not a thing that happened; and
  `Q65114870` and `Q65115220` have no English label at all.
- **An edge from `raid-on-pebble-island` to the landings.** The obvious story
  — the SAS destroyed the aircraft that would have met the beachhead — is not
  in either lead, and this run does not write the edge a source does not state.

### The class table

Seven classes were added to `data/imports/wikidata-seeds.json` → `classes`,
each read off Wikidata rather than guessed, because the import refuses an item
whose class the table does not hold: `Q645883` military operation, `Q1546073`
covert operation, `Q476807` military raid, `Q650711` combat, `Q997267`
skirmish and `Q1303061` friendly fire, all `war`; and `Q744913` aviation
accident, `disaster`. **The Gazelle incident of 6 June carries the last two
at once and so takes no category at all** — `classify()` leaves a category
unset where the table disagrees rather than picking one, which is the right
answer here: an aviation accident is a disaster and friendly fire is war, and
nothing should choose between them on a record nobody has read.

| **all** | **314 / 88** | **79 / 32** | **117 / 68** | **104 / 59** | **—** | **—** | **614 / 247** |

*Two active events carry no start year and fall in no century; batch 1's table
folded them into the 20th, which is why its europe row reads 238 / 66 where
this one reads 238 / 65 and 1 / 1. Nothing moved between them.*

**The main count did not rise.** Twenty-two events arrived and the resting
timeline gained no bar at all: every one of them is inside `falklands-war`,
which was already main and already drawn. This is the trade batch 1 said the
Americas would offer — *"a batch taken there costs nothing in main count"* —
and it is what an umbrella already in the corpus is worth.

**The component grew by two and eighteen records joined it with no edge.**
That is the same finding batch 1 wrote down and M42's batch 34 before it: the
phases of one war are chronological to each other and their leads argue no
causation between them. Two of the four edges reach records that were already
here, which is what moved the number; the other eighteen events are held in
the picture by their parent and nothing was invented to connect them.

**South and Central America against North America**, retaken: 69 active events
with a place south of 25.9°N, 8 north of it, 27 still placeless in the lane.
The brief's ordering still does not bind — the south holds nine times what the
north does — and North America is still the thinner half of the lane by a long
way.

## Batch 3 — the Colombian conflict's vein, filed and placed

*22 September, the third fire. Taken from the **`americas` lane** again, and
from the same partition's largest open vein: batch 2 measured
`colombian-conflict` at 41 rows against the Falklands' 39, and left it for a
fire that had the time. The cell is the 20th and 21st centuries of that lane,
where the lane held 64 and 9 active events against Europe's 238 and 52.*

**Why this vein and why now.** Batch 2's note ranked it first for the fire that
picked it up, on two grounds, and both held. It is free of the year problem:
`colombian-conflict` runs 1964 to an open end, and every dated row of the
sweep falls inside that, so nothing had to be widened under A7 and the main
count could not move. And its rows are spread over forty-five years rather
than eleven weeks, so the lane's timeline gains depth and not only bulk — the
twenty-one records that arrived run from 1980 to 2025.

The inverse `part of` sweep on `Q169072` returned **43 distinct items**, two of
which the atlas already held (`colombian-peace-process`,
`assassination-of-miguel-uribe-turbay`). `git fetch origin m42` was answered by
the merge at the head of this fire: `origin/m42` is an ancestor of `m42b` as of
`cb0e3e49`, so the whole of M42's corpus was on disk when the sweep was
compared against it and no item of the other lane's could be taken twice.

### What arrived

Twenty-one events. **Two of them are umbrellas of their own** — the phases the
Spanish and English Wikipedias name — and the other nineteen are filed under
whichever of the three fits closest.

| the record | filed under | placed at | precision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `colombian-conflict-between-1974-1990` | `colombian-conflict` | — (a period has no point) | — |
| `colombian-conflict-2018-present` | `colombian-conflict` | — (a period has no point) | — |
| `1980-dominican-embassy-siege-in-bogota` | `colombian-conflict-between-1974-1990` | `bogota` | city |
| `palace-of-justice-siege` | `colombian-conflict-between-1974-1990` | `bogota` | city |
| `honduras-and-la-negra-farms-massacre` | `colombian-conflict-between-1974-1990` | `uraba-choco` | region |
| `mondonedo-massacre` | `colombian-conflict` | `cundinamarca-department` | region |
| `siege-of-mitu` | `colombian-conflict` | `mitu` | city |
| `1999-2002-farc-government-peace-process` | `colombian-conflict` | `san-vicente-del-caguan` | city |
| `las-palmas-massacre` | `colombian-conflict` | `san-jacinto` | city |
| `boyaca-necklace-bomb-incident` | `colombian-conflict` | `chiquinquira` | city |
| `attack-on-cerro-montezuma` | `colombian-conflict` | `pueblo-rico` | city |
| `false-positives-in-colombia` | `colombian-conflict` | `colombia-q739` | country |
| `bombing-in-zona-rosa-of-bogota-of-2003` | `colombian-conflict` | `chapinero` | city |
| `house-bomb-attack-in-neiva` | `colombian-conflict` | `neiva` | city |
| `operation-jm` | `colombian-conflict` | `colombia-q739` | country |
| `operation-jaque` | `colombian-conflict` | `guaviare-department` | region |
| `andino-shopping-mall-attack` | `colombian-conflict` | `bogota` | city |
| `atentado-a-la-estacion-de-policia-de-barranquilla` | `colombian-conflict-2018-present` | `bolivar-department` | region |
| `catatumbo-campaign` | `colombian-conflict-2018-present` | `catatumbo-river` | region |
| `2019-bogota-car-bombing` | `colombian-conflict-2018-present` | `bogota` | city |
| `united-states-military-campaign-against-cartels` | `colombian-conflict-2018-present` | `caribbean-sea` | region |

One record the atlas already held was re-filed: `assassination-of-miguel-uribe-turbay`,
of June 2025, moves from `colombian-conflict` to `colombian-conflict-2018-present`,
which is inside it.

### The two umbrellas, and what A8 actually asked for

`colombian-conflict-between-1974-1990` (`Q76763052`, a *historical period*) and
`colombian-conflict-2018-present` (`Q118152947`, a *war phase*) are periods and
carry `m42-umbrella`, a lane and no place: A6's rule is that a period Wikipedia
names, with a span and a region, is a legitimate umbrella, and the same
paragraph is why neither is given a point on the map. Both are filed under
`colombian-conflict`, which is a war and not a period, so A6's "do not nest
periods more than one deep" is not touched.

**The first reading of A8 here was wrong and the suite caught it.** A8 says a
filing writes *every* umbrella whose span and subject fit, so the eight events
inside a phase were first written with both the phase and the conflict as
parents. `tests/m42-filing.test.mjs` refuses that — *"no parent of an event is
reachable through another of its parents"* — and it is right: the phase is
already inside the conflict, so naming the conflict as well widens the record
and tells a reader nothing the tree did not. Every event here carries **the
narrowest umbrella that holds it** and nothing above it. A8's list is for
umbrellas that reach a record by different routes, which is the owner's own
example — Angolan independence under the Portuguese Third Republic *and* under
the decolonisation of Africa, neither inside the other — and not for a chain of
containers.

### Places (A9)

**Fourteen place records, each from the first located thing its event's item
names that carries a `P625`**, with `precision` read off that item's own class
rather than the hard-coded `point` the import still writes:

| precision | places | read off the class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `city` | `bogota`, `neiva`, `mitu`, `chiquinquira`, `pueblo-rico`, `san-jacinto`, `san-vicente-del-caguan`, `chapinero` | big city, city of Colombia, municipality of Colombia, locality — settlements |
| `region` | `cundinamarca-department`, `bolivar-department`, `guaviare-department`, `uraba-choco`, `catatumbo-river`, `caribbean-sea` | department of Colombia, subregion, river, sea — larger than a settlement and not a state |
| `country` | `colombia-q739` (already here, from M42's own place pass) | — |

`P276` answered for every one of them but three, where the item names only its
country: `operation-jm` and `colombian-conflict-2018-present` carry `P17`
Colombia alone, and `false-positives-in-colombia` names both Colombia and
Soacha under `P276`. The scandal is kept at the country: the article calls it
"a series of murders in Colombia" rather than an event at Soacha, and the
import's own choice was the country.

**Nothing was invented.** Four events of the vein carry their own `P625` and a
`P276` that is a whole department — `mondonedo-massacre` is the clearest — and
the department is what they were given, because A9 places an event at a thing
the atlas can name and not at a bare coordinate. The two periods are placeless
on purpose.

### Summaries (A12 C1)

**Sixteen of the twenty-one carry the cached English lead at a named revision**
in place of the import's placeholder, in the shape 277 records already have:
the first three sentences quoted, the revision in the locator, a `wikipedia-en`
citation added and the `summary-from-lead` flag. Five keep the placeholder
because the English Wikipedia has no article to quote: `mondonedo-massacre`,
`las-palmas-massacre`, `attack-on-cerro-montezuma` and both periods. Each of
the five has an article in Spanish, which this atlas does not cache and this
run did not translate.

### The edges (A5, M72)

Two, each from what a lead states in so many words, each `probable` — rule 22
refuses `consensus` on a Wikipedia citation — and **both running into records
the atlas already held**, which is what A5 asks of a batch.

| the edge | into what existed | what the source says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `colombian-conflict --reacted-to--> 1999-2002-farc-government-peace-process` | yes | the process *"was a failed peace process … in an effort to bring to an end the ongoing Colombian armed conflict"* |
| `colombian-peace-process --enabled--> catatumbo-campaign` | yes | the campaign *"is an extension of the war on drugs and developed after the Colombian peace process of 2016"* |

The first is the same reading, and the same direction, as the edge this atlas
already carries between the conflict and the 2012–2016 negotiations, and the
two peace processes are seventeen years apart. The second is written at the
weakest type the vocabulary has because that is as far as the article goes: it
names the accord as what the campaign developed after and argues no mechanism,
and `enabled` says the earlier record made room for the later rather than
brought it about.

### What was refused, and why

- **Sixteen items of the vein with no date at all.** `Q335761` the taking of
  Miraflores, `Q402072` Las Delicias, `Q798637` Operation Casa Verde,
  `Q1032474` Girasoles, `Q1032901` the retaking of the demilitarized zone,
  `Q2268234` Operation Odiseo, `Q2269075` Quebrada El Billar, `Q2269121`
  Operation Dinastía, `Q2270085` Operation Némesis, `Q2270108` Operation
  Berlín, `Q3354631` Operation Anorí, `Q10341149` Operation Traira,
  `Q11202460` San Marino, `Q20537497` Tarazá, `Q115087946` and
  `Q8034813` the Workers Revolutionary Party. Every one of them is a real
  action of this war and Wikidata gives none of them a `P580` or a `P585`;
  the import refuses an item with no year and this run does not supply one,
  which is batch 2's ruling on nine Falklands items taken again.
- **`Q14186580` the 2013 Colombian clashes**, refused by the import itself:
  its item names no location the atlas could reach a lane through.
- **`Q155801` FARC**, the largest row of the sweep, as batch 2 already refused
  it: an actor is what it would be here and this is an events batch. Its two
  Wikidata classes — *terrorist organization* and *guerrilla organization* —
  are not in the class table, and adding either is a vocabulary decision on a
  record nobody has read, not a mechanical one.
- **`Q105799250` "Guerrilla Executions in Colombia"**, whose only class is
  *violence*. It is a topic article and not a thing that happened on a day.
- **`Q79227232` women's rights in the Colombian peace agreements**, refused by
  the class table: *human rights by country or territory* is a subject, not an
  event.
- **An edge from `2019-bogota-car-bombing` to `andino-shopping-mall-attack`.**
  The 2019 lead names the 2017 bombing — *"the first terrorist attack on the
  capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing"* — but that is a comparison and
  not a claim that one brought on the other. The same refusal batch 2 made over
  Pebble Island.

### The class table

Eleven classes were added to `data/imports/wikidata-seeds.json` → `classes`,
each read off Wikidata rather than guessed. Four are event classes: `Q188055`
siege and `Q105370834` war phase, both `war`; `Q20893947` suicide car bombing
and `Q1456892` peace process, neither with a category, because `bomb attack`
and `terrorist attack` carry none either and what a peace process is is not one
of the twelve. Seven are place classes, carrying no category at all:
`Q2555896` municipality of Colombia, `Q215655` department of Colombia,
`Q63209072` city of Colombia, `Q15701038` subregion of Antioquia Department,
`Q165` sea, `Q4022` river and `Q3257686` locality.

### The suites

`tests/m42-filing.test.mjs` now reads `docs/m42b-pool.md` beside
`docs/m42-pool.md`: the clause that a filing nobody argued in writing fails is
what makes this section load-bearing, and until this fire the suite could not
see the branch's own arguments at all. `docs/m53-polities.md` §4.1's "after
M42" row is retaken at 351 of 643, as that document says it is at every batch
of the milestone — the numerator does not move, because everything an import
writes carries `actors: []` and M67's amendment A1 says that is not a defect.

### The counts

*The corpus this batch found was not the one batch 2 left: the fire began by
merging `origin/m0` and `origin/m42`, which brought M42's own batches, its A12
passes and its place pass across. That is why the before column reads 622 and
242 where batch 2's after column read 614 and 247 — five events M42 filed are
main no longer, and the merge is where the difference came from, not this
batch.*

**The main count did not rise.** Twenty-one events arrived and the resting
timeline gained no bar: nineteen are inside `colombian-conflict`, which was
already main and already drawn, and the two that are not are the periods, which
are inside it too.

**The component grew by two and nineteen records joined it with no edge.** The
same finding batch 2 wrote down: the actions of one war are chronological to
each other and their leads argue no causation between them. Both edges reach
records that were already here, which is what moved the number; the other
nineteen events are held in the picture by their parent, and nothing was
invented to connect them.

**The `americas` lane passed Asia's active count and is now level with it** —
125 against 125, where batch 2 left it at 104 against 117. Its main count did
not move at all, which is what an umbrella already in the corpus is worth.
**South and Central America against North America**, retaken: 104 active events
with a place south of 25.9°N, 17 north of it, 4 still placeless in the lane.
The brief's ordering still does not bind.

## Batch 4 — the Cuban Revolution's vein, widened first and then filled

*22 September, the fourth fire. Taken from the **`americas` lane** again, and
from the vein batch 3's note ranked first for whoever picked it up: sixteen
rows the atlas could not take while its umbrella was dated at a single day.
The cell is the 20th century of that lane.*

**A7 first, in its own commit.** This atlas dated `cuban-revolution` at 1959
alone, with the day Havana fell, so every action of the revolution's own
fighting fell outside its parent and rule 24 would have refused the filing.
The English article, at **revision 1373305240 — the revision the record already
cites** — states the span in its infobox, `26 July 1953 – 1 January 1959`, and
names the Moncada assault of 26 July 1953 in its lead. So the record now reads
1953 to 1959 with both days, carries the `a7-widened` flag and a note saying
what moved from what, and the vein files itself. Nothing else on the record
changed.

**The sweep.** The inverse `part of` sweep on `Q11264` returned **16 distinct
items and the atlas held none of them** — `origin/m42` had been merged into
this branch at the head of the fire, so M42's whole corpus was on disk when the
comparison was made and no item of the other lane's could be taken twice.
Fifteen were imported. Every one of the fifteen falls inside the widened span,
so the main count could not move.

### What arrived

| the record | filed under | placed at | precision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `attack-on-the-moncada-barracks` | `cuban-revolution` | `santiago-de-cuba` | city (already here) |
| `carlos-manuel-de-cespedes-barracks-attack-1953` | `cuban-revolution` | `bayamo` | city |
| `haitian-embassy-in-cuba-massacre` | `cuban-revolution` | — (see below) | — |
| `1956-cuartel-domingo-goicuria-assault` | `cuban-revolution` | `matanzas` | city |
| `santiago-de-cuba-uprising` | `cuban-revolution` | `santiago-de-cuba` | city (already here) |
| `battle-of-alegria-de-pio` | `cuban-revolution` | `alegria-de-pio` | city |
| `battle-of-la-plata-1957` | `cuban-revolution` | `bartolome-maso-cuba` | city |
| `havana-presidential-palace-attack-1957` | `cuban-revolution` | `havana` | city (already here) |
| `humboldt-7-massacre` | `cuban-revolution` | `havana` | city (already here) |
| `corynthia-expedition` | `cuban-revolution` | `mayari` | city |
| `cienfuegos-uprising` | `cuban-revolution` | `cienfuegos` | city |
| `operation-verano` | `cuban-revolution` | `sierra-maestra` | region |
| `battle-of-guisa` | `cuban-revolution` | `oriente-province` | region |
| `battle-of-yaguajay` | `cuban-revolution` | `yaguajay-cuba` | city |
| `battle-of-santa-clara` | `cuban-revolution` | `santa-clara-cuba` | city |

**Every one of the fifteen carries `cuban-revolution` and nothing above it**,
which is deviation 1203's rule applied from the start rather than caught by the
suite: the revolution is the narrowest umbrella the atlas holds for any of them
and there is no phase record between.

### Places (A9)

**Ten place records, each from the first located thing its event's item names
that carries a `P625`**, with `precision` read off that item's own class and
not the hard-coded `point` `placeRecord()` still writes:

| precision | places | read off the class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `city` | `bayamo`, `matanzas`, `alegria-de-pio`, `bartolome-maso-cuba`, `mayari`, `cienfuegos`, `yaguajay-cuba`, `santa-clara-cuba` | city, locality, municipality of Cuba — settlements |
| `region` | `oriente-province`, `sierra-maestra` | province of Cuba, mountain range — larger than a settlement and not a state |

Four events were placed at records the atlas already held: `santiago-de-cuba`
twice and `havana` twice. Neither of those two carries a Wikidata item, so a
later sweep of `Q117040` or `Q1563` would create a second record for the same
town; **filling that identity gap is a job for a fire with `--reconcile`**, and
this one did not do it by hand.

**One place was named from the item's own Spanish label.** `Q16145269` carries
a label in Spanish alone, so the import fell back to the QID for the id, the
label and the names, and a place called `Q16145269` is a place a reader cannot
read. Its own field says `Alegría de Pío`, and reading it is reading the item:
the record is `alegria-de-pio`, the `title-not-english` flag stays, and a note
on the record says where the name came from. That is not the case of deviation
1201's refusal at `Q15542964`, which was somebody else's label needing
*correction*; nothing here was corrected or translated.

**One event is placeless and this is why.** `haitian-embassy-in-cuba-massacre`
names the embassy of Haiti in Cuba under `P276`, which carries no `P625`; it
has no `P131`; and its `P17` is `Q14905932`, the historical Republic of Cuba,
which is a *period* and not ground. The chain runs out with nothing to point
at, and A9 places an event at a thing the atlas can name or not at all. It has
no participant either, so `docs/m67-umbrellas.md` carries the A1 clause for it.

### Summaries (A12 C1)

**Twelve of the fifteen carry the cached English lead at a named revision** in
place of the import's placeholder, in the shape the corpus already uses: the
first three sentences quoted, the revision in the locator, a `wikipedia-en`
citation added and the `summary-from-lead` flag. Three keep the placeholder
because the English Wikipedia has no article to quote:
`carlos-manuel-de-cespedes-barracks-attack-1953`,
`1956-cuartel-domingo-goicuria-assault` and `haitian-embassy-in-cuba-massacre`.

### Actors (A12 C5)

**None.** Two of the fifteen carry `P710`: both name `Q218452` and
`Q14905932`, and the atlas holds neither as an actor — its `cuba` record is
`Q241`, a different item. C5 maps a participant *the atlas holds*, so nothing
was written, and M67 A1 settles that an event with no actor is not a defect.

### The edges (A5, M72)

**Six, each `probable` on the leads that support it** — rule 22 refuses
`consensus` on a Wikipedia citation — and **two of them run into records that
were already here**:

| edge | type | what the source states |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `attack-on-the-moncada-barracks` → `cuban-revolution` | `caused` | the attack of 26 July 1953 "is widely accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution" |
| `cuban-revolution` → `operation-verano` | `reacted-to` | the 1958 offensive "was designed to crush Fidel Castro's revolutionary army, which had been growing in strength ... since their arrival ... in December 1956" |
| `operation-verano` → `battle-of-santa-clara` | `enabled` | Verano "failed in its objective", "left the Cuban army dispirited and demoralized", and "Castro ... soon launched his own offensive" |
| `santiago-de-cuba-uprising` → `battle-of-alegria-de-pio` | `precondition-of` | the failed uprising meant "the rebels had lost the element of surprise, and the military was put on high alert in the region" |
| `battle-of-alegria-de-pio` → `battle-of-la-plata-1957` | `precondition-of` | La Plata was "the first battle of the revolution ... which was a success for the rebels, who had previously suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Alegría de Pío" |
| `havana-presidential-palace-attack-1957` → `humboldt-7-massacre` | `caused` | the four men killed by Havana police on 20 April 1957 "had taken part in the Havana Presidential Palace attack" |

Two of the six were written after the first measurement, because the first four
moved the component by **one** and A5 says a batch that grows the corpus and
not the component has to say why. The answer was that the vein hung off
`cuban-revolution` by its *parent*, which by design is not adjacency, so only
Moncada reached the graph. The two added — the revolution to Verano, and
Alegría de Pío to La Plata — are the two the leads state plainly, and they
carried Verano and Santa Clara in with them.

### What was refused, and why

- **`Q4693758`, "land reform in Cuba"** — the sixteenth row of the sweep. It
  carries no `P580`, no `P582` and no `P585`, and its class `Q208128` is not in
  the table. A record with no date is not one this run writes.
- **The Landing of the Granma** — not refused on its merits but not reached:
  see deviation 1205. It is the hinge three of this vein's leads point at, and
  the fire that takes it joins the island of three that is left.
- **Filing any of the fifteen under a phase** — there is no phase record
  between them and the revolution, and this run did not write one: A6 asks for
  a period Wikipedia names with a span and a region, and the revolution's own
  article names its phases only as narrative sections.

*The before column is this branch's own head after batch 3 and after the two
merges at the head of this fire. Europe's 15th, 16th and 19th centuries read
higher than batch 3's table — 3, 6 and 12 against 1, 1 and 9 — and none of that
is this batch: it came across with `origin/m42` and `origin/m0`.*

**The main count did not rise.** Fifteen events arrived and the resting
timeline gained no bar: every one is inside `cuban-revolution`, which was
already main and already drawn.

**The component grew by three and twelve records joined with no edge.** The
same finding batches 2 and 3 wrote down, and it is a fact about the sources
rather than about the run: the actions of one revolution are chronological to
each other and their leads argue no causation between them. What is different
here is that three of the twelve are *not* isolated — they are an island of
three (`santiago-de-cuba-uprising`, `battle-of-alegria-de-pio`,
`battle-of-la-plata-1957`) that every lead ties to the Granma landing, which
this atlas does not hold and this fire could not fetch.

**South and Central America against North America**, retaken: **118 active
events with a place south of 25.9°N, 17 north of it, 5 placeless in the lane.**
Cuba is on the southern side of that line, so the brief's ordering still does
not bind and the north is still the thin half.

## Batch 5 — the Thirty Years' War, and Europe's seventeenth century

*22 September, the fifth fire. Taken from **the cell that trails most in this
partition and in the whole atlas**: Europe's 17th century, which held **one
active event** — `royal-african-company`, and it is dated 1660 — and no
umbrella of any kind. The 18th is the same size and needs the same treatment;
the 17th was taken first because the umbrella the century lacks is the one
with the largest vein behind it.*

**Why the Thirty Years' War and not the Granma.** The last fire's note put the
Landing of the Granma first, on the ground that it was one item and the hinge
of an island of three. **It is not an event item.** The English article
*"Landing of the Granma"* is the sitelink of `Q372672`, whose label is
*Granma*, whose description is *yacht*, and whose classes are the classes of a
ship; it carries no `P580`, no `P585` and no `P361`, and it is not among the
sixteen items that are `part of` `Q11264`. There is nothing here to import as
an event, and writing one from the article's title would be inventing the
record rather than reading it. **Deviation 1206.** The island of three stands.

**The rule, the same three tests the earlier batches use.** An item enters
only if it is `part of` something this atlas holds or is the umbrella the cell
lacks; its span must sit inside the parent's; its lane must be this
partition's. Ranked by sitelinks, ties by item id. The inverse `part of` sweep
on `Q2487` returned **171 items and the atlas held none of them**; the top
twenty that are Europe and are not this atlas's already were taken, and the
umbrella with them.

### What arrived

| the record | sitelinks | filed under | placed at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `thirty-years-war` | 124 | — (the umbrella) | placeless, see below |
| `battle-of-lutzen-1632` | 38 | `thirty-years-war` | `lutzen` |

| `battle-of-breitenfeld-1642` | 17 | `thirty-years-war` | `breitenfeld-leipzig` |

| `battle-of-freiburg` | 15 | `thirty-years-war` | `freiburg-im-breisgau` |
| `battle-of-jankau` | 15 | `thirty-years-war` | `jankov-benesov-district` |
| `siege-of-stralsund-1628` | 15 | `thirty-years-war` | `stralsund` |
| `battle-of-prague-1648` | 15 | `thirty-years-war` | `prague` (already here) |

**Twenty events, twenty summaries.** Every one of the twenty has an English
article, so every one carries the cached lead at a named revision in place of
the import's placeholder, with the `wikipedia-en` citation beside it and the
`summary-from-lead` flag. No record in this batch shows the placeholder alone.

**Eleven new place records and one reused.** `lutzen`, `breitenfeld-leipzig`,
`nordlingen`, `lutter-am-barenberge`, `rain-swabia`, `plzen`,
`lens-pas-de-calais`, `freiburg-im-breisgau`, `jankov-benesov-district` and
`stralsund` at `city` precision, `prague-castle` at `point`,
`smolensk-voivodeship` at `region`; `battle-of-prague-1648` takes the `prague`
this atlas already held. The precision is read off the class Wikidata gives
each item and replaces the `point` the import still writes for everything.

**Which located item a battle takes, when the item names more than one.** The
corrected A9 order is the event's own `P625` first, then `P276`, `P131`,
`P17`. Fifteen of the twenty carry their own point, and where a battle's
`P276` and `P131` disagree the batch took **the located item whose own point
is nearest the event's own `P625`** — arithmetic over two coordinates Wikidata
already publishes, and no judgement. It matters once: Wikidata gives the
Battle of Lützen `P276` Leipzig (17 km away) and `P131` Lützen (1 km), and the
mark belongs at Lützen. Every other choice was the first candidate anyway, and
none of the eleven places sits more than 5 km from the event that names it.

### The five filed records that name neither an actor nor a place

M67's rule asks that a child filed under an umbrella with no actor line and no
place be argued for somewhere a person can read. These are the five, and the
reason is the same in four of them: **the located thing Wikidata names for
them is a country or larger**, which is the case deviation 1201 settled on
this branch — a point that stands for something country-sized is written on
the map across the middle of it.

- `thirty-years-war` — `P276` is `Q27509` *Central Europe*, a region of
  Europe. Placeless, as `italian-wars` is, and for the same reason.
- `torstenson-war` — `P276` is `Q35` *Denmark*.
- `bohemian-revolt` — `P276` is `Q686971` *Lands of the Bohemian Crown*, a
  monarchy and not a town.
- `war-of-the-mantuan-succession` — `P276` is `Q4345530` *Northern Italy*, the
  same class as the Italian Peninsula deviation 1201 withdrew.
- `edict-of-restitution` — it names no location at all beyond `P17`
  `Q12548`, the Holy Roman Empire. Its own lead says it was proclaimed in
  Vienna; Wikidata does not say so in a claim, and the atlas does not take a
  place out of prose.

`battle-of-the-downs` is the fifth of the four, and it is a different case:
it carries its own `P625`, but the only located item it names is `Q34640`, the
English Channel — **283 km from the event's own point**, and a sea besides.
The anchorage the battle is named for has no item here, so the record is
placeless rather than pinned to the wrong water. Its filing is also the one in
this batch that rests on the item and not on the article: Wikidata makes it
`part of` the Thirty Years' War, while its own lead says it *"took place on 21
October 1639, during the Eighty Years' War"* — a war this atlas does not hold.
Both are true of it in the ordinary telling; the filing follows the statement
that points at a record which exists.

### The edges, and why there are two

`bohemian-revolt --caused--> thirty-years-war` and
`bohemian-revolt --enabled--> siege-of-pilsen`, both `probable`, both on the
lead that states them:

- the revolt's article, revision 1372461973: *"an uprising of the Bohemian
  estates against the rule of the Habsburg dynasty **that began the Thirty
  Years' War**"*;
- the siege's article, revision 1370744459: *"**Following the Bohemian
  Revolt**, a Bohemian army under Ernst von Mansfeld captured Plzeň."*

**Eighteen of the twenty arrived with no edge at all, and the largest
connected component did not move.** A5 says a batch that grows the corpus and
not the component has to say why, and this batch can say it precisely, because
the war's own article says it for us. The Thirty Years' War's lead lists its
neighbours in exactly these words: *"**Related conflicts include** the Eighty
Years' War, the War of the Mantuan Succession, the Franco-Spanish War, the
Torstenson War, the Dutch–Portuguese War, and the Portuguese Restoration
War."* *Related* is the strongest word on offer, and it is not one of the five
edge types. The same holds one level down: eleven of the twelve battle leads
say only that the battle *took place during* the war and who beat whom, and
three of them are a single sentence long. This is the third fire to write the
finding down — batches 1, 3 and 4 each found it in their own vein — and it is
a fact about how encyclopaedia leads are written, not about the run: **a
war's parts are narrated in sequence, and sequence is not one of the five
things an edge may say.** Nothing was invented to connect them; the umbrella
is what holds them in the picture.

There is also nothing in the twenty leads that names a record this atlas
already held. The corpus's nearest neighbours in time are
`dutch-brazil-1630-1654`, `english-settlement-of-barbados-1627` and
`royal-african-company`, and none of the twenty articles mentions any of them.

### What was refused, and why

- **`Q372672`, the Granma** — deviation 1206 above: a yacht, not an event.
- **`Q1501724` Portuguese Restoration War** (33 sitelinks, the fourth-largest
  row in the vein) — it runs 1640 to 1688, forty years past the umbrella's
  end, so filing it under the Thirty Years' War would date a child outside its
  parent. It is a main event of its own or it is nothing, and a batch under
  the standing rule may not make it one. It is the best single row left in
  this vein and it is first on the next fire's list if that fire is willing to
  spend a main event on it.
- **`Q1340672` Hakkapeliitta** (20 sitelinks) — Finnish light cavalry. A kind
  of soldier is not a thing that happened.
- **`Q1615804` Hessian War** — 1567 to 1658, a span that contains the
  umbrella rather than sitting inside it.
- **`sweden` as an actor of the war** — Wikidata gives `Q2487` fifteen
  `P710` participants and exactly one of them is an actor this atlas holds:
  `Q34`, which is `data/actors/sweden.json`. **That record is dated 1886 to
  now**, because it came from CShapes and is the modern state. Naming it as a
  belligerent of a war that ended in 1648 is the fault `tests/m56.test.mjs`
  exists to catch, so the batch wrote no actor line at all. M67's amendment A1
  settles that this is not a defect.
- **Every item of the vein outside Europe** — `Q2890933` Puerto de Cavite and
  the rest of the Asian theatre are M42's lane, not this one.

*The before column is this branch's own head after the two merges at the top
of this fire — `origin/m0` through M83 and `origin/m42` through its batch 36 —
and not batch 4's table, which measured a smaller corpus.*

**The main count rose by one and A6 says a batch that does that has to say
why.** The one is `thirty-years-war`, and it is the trade batch 1 made and
named: the century had one active event and nothing to hang anything from, so
it could not be filled at all without a top-level record. **Twenty records
arrived and the resting timeline gained one bar.** The 151 rows of this vein
that are still unimported now file under it for nothing, and so does the
Portuguese Restoration War if a later fire decides to pay for it.

### Deviations

**1206. The Landing of the Granma is not an event item, and the last fire's
note was wrong to rank it first.** Set out at the head of this section. The
lesson is narrower than it looks: **a Wikipedia article title is not evidence
that Wikidata holds an item for the thing the title names.** *"Landing of the
Granma"* is the English sitelink of the item for the boat. The previous fire
never resolved the title, because it was rate-limited before it could
(deviation 1205), and it wrote the recommendation from the three leads that
name the landing rather than from the item. Nothing was imported on it, so
nothing has to be undone; what is corrected is the note.

**1207. Four items were refused for want of a lane and re-asked, and the
tool's own `done` list was edited to re-ask them.** `peace-of-prague-1635`,
`smolensk-war`, `bohemian-revolt` and `war-of-the-mantuan-succession` were
refused on the first pass — *"no lane reachable from its point, and no lane
named for it in the seeds file"* — because the located things they name carry
no point the lane derivation reaches. The four are Europe by any reading, and
`data/imports/wikidata-seeds.json` → `lanes` is the table that exists for
exactly this. The entries were added there, which is data and not code; but
the import had already written the four into `runs.import.done` in
`data/imports/wikidata-state.json`, which is the tool's own file, and a
refused item is never asked again. The four ids were removed from that list
and the import re-run. **Written down because editing a file the tool writes
is not the ordinary path**, and because the ordinary path should exist: an
item refused for a gap the seeds file can close belongs back in `pending`, not
in `done`.

**1208. The Edict of Restitution's end was set to the day its own article
gives, against the `end-unstated` flag the import wrote.** `Q703097` carries
`P580` 6 March 1629 and no `P582`, so `intervalFor()` wrote `end: null` with
the flag — which is the corrected rule working as intended, and which the
atlas reads as *still going*. Filed under a war that ends in 1648, that made
the edict a child dated outside its parent, and `tests/m62.test.mjs` and
`tests/m67.test.mjs` both fail on it. The record names a **proclamation**, and
its own cited article dates that act and nothing else: *"The Edict of
Restitution was proclaimed by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna, on 6
March 1629"* (revision 1285679503). So the end is that same day, the flag is
gone, and `review.note` says what was changed and why. **How long the edict
stayed in force is a different question and this record does not answer it** —
the Peace of Prague of 1635, which is also in this batch, is where a reviewer
would start on it. Reading a cited source is not inventing a date, which is
A7's own reasoning applied in the narrowing direction rather than the widening
one.

**1209. The index was rebuilt before the records were committed, and the check
went red on rule 16 for it — twice, once at the `origin/m42` merge and once at
this batch.** Deviation 798's order is *records first, rebuild, then commit the
index*, and the reason is `tools/lib/history.mjs`: a record's versions are read
out of **the commits that touched its file**, so an index built while the
records are still in the working tree is filed under history shard names that a
fresh build at the pushed commit does not reproduce. Rule 16 is what catches
it, and it catches it in CI rather than locally, because `validate --index`
against an uncommitted tree compares a build to itself. Three shards moved this
time — `history-edge-1600-1699`, `history-event-1600-1699` and
`history-place-place` — and the fix is one more rebuild and one more commit.
**The order in 798 is not a style rule and a fire that rebuilds first will go
red every time.** The merge commit `86e1144b` is red on the branch for exactly
this and is superseded rather than re-run.

## Batch 6 — the French Revolution, and Europe's eighteenth century

*22 September, the sixth fire. Taken from **the cell that trails most in this
partition**: Europe's 18th century, which held **one active event** —
`the-british-industrial-revolution` — and no umbrella of any kind. That is
exactly what the fifth fire's note said the sixth should take, and it is
batch 5's problem one century later with the same answer: the umbrella the
century lacks, and the vein behind it.*

**Two merges before anything was imported.** `origin/m0` (M84 and the M85
brief) and `origin/m42` (through its batch 37) were both ahead of this branch
and both came across, `data/index/` dropped and rebuilt rather than merged.
The merge is why this batch's *before* column reads 703 active and not batch
5's 698, and why Europe's 17th century reads 21 and not the 6 batch 5 left:
fifteen of that came with `origin/m42`.

**Why the French Revolution and not the War of the Spanish Succession.** The
fifth fire's note named three candidates for the century — the Spanish
Succession, the Seven Years' War and the French Revolution — and the last of
them is the one that is worth two things at once. Its inverse `part of` sweep
returned **44 items and this atlas held none of them**, which is the largest
vein of the three; and it is the one whose period umbrella, the Atlantic
Revolutions, reaches across the partition to a record the atlas already has.

### What arrived

Ranked by sitelinks, ties by item id, the same three tests the earlier batches
use: an item enters only if it is `part of` something this atlas holds or is
the umbrella the cell lacks, its span sits inside the parent's, and its lane is
this partition's.

**Nineteen events, nineteen summaries.** Every one has an English article, so
every one carries the cached lead at a named revision in place of the import's
placeholder, with the `wikipedia-en` citation beside it and the
`summary-from-lead` flag. No record in this batch shows the placeholder alone.

### The Atlantic Revolutions, and why the main count did not rise

The umbrella over the umbrella is the piece of this batch that is not batch 5
again. `Q3108868` is a **revolutionary wave** with a stated span
(1765-03-22 to 1838-12-04) and an article of its own, which is A6's period
umbrella exactly: *"a period from the late-18th to the mid-19th centuries
during which a number of significant revolutionary movements occurred in most
of Europe and the Americas"* (*Age of Revolution*, revision 1374214786). Two
records are filed under it:

- `french-revolution` — inside the span, in Europe, and a revolutionary
  movement in the article's own words. M62's span-and-subject property, with
  the region as the subject, which is what A6 asks for.
- `haitian-revolution-1791-1804` — the same, and Wikidata says so outright:
  `Q689128` carries `P361` `Q3108868`. This atlas has held that record since
  M50 and it is in the `americas` lane, so **the umbrella crosses the
  partition**, which is the point of taking it.

**That is why the main count is unchanged at 243.** Two umbrellas arrived and
would have cost two; the Atlantic Revolutions took the French Revolution and
the Haitian Revolution out of the resting picture, which gives both back. The
seventeen of the vein were never main. Batches 1 and 5 each paid one main
event for their umbrella and wrote down why; this one paid none, and the
reason is the period umbrella rather than any restraint about the vein.

**The other two members of the wave were left.** The sweep on `Q3108868`
returned only `Q689128` and `Q1123201` (the Spanish American wars of
independence, 1808–1833, 45 sitelinks). The second is a good row and squarely
this partition's, but it is a vein of its own and not this batch's: it belongs
to the fire that takes the Americas' 19th century, where it will file under
the same umbrella at no cost in main events.

### Places (A9)

**Eight new place records, two reused.** The corrected order — the event's own
`P625` first, then `P276`, `P131`, `P17` — placed ten of the nineteen.
`versailles-yvelines` at `city` precision; `bastille`,
`chateau-de-saint-cloud`, `salle-du-jeu-de-paume`, `prison-de-l-abbaye`,
`tuileries-palace`, `champ-de-mars` and `place-de-la-concorde` at `point`,
which is what their classes say they are — a fortress, two palaces, a tennis
court, a prison and two public squares. `insurrection-of-10-august-1792` and
`13-vendemiaire` took the `paris` this atlas already held, through the
import's own reuse.

**Where the candidates disagreed, the nearest to the event's own point won**,
as batch 5 settled. It mattered once and awkwardly: the Coup of 18 Brumaire
carries its own `P625` in central Paris and names `Q662491` the Château de
Saint-Cloud (10 km) and `Q58296` the French First Republic (2 km). The
nearer of the two is a **state**, which is not a place of this atlas at all,
so the rule was read over the located items that are places and the château
took it — which is also where the coup happened.

**`september-massacres` is the one a reviewer should look at.** Its `P276`
names twenty locations — six Paris prisons and then Meaux, Lyon, Caen,
Reims, Versailles, Sens, Marseille, Toulon, Lorient and Gisors, because the
killings spread. The atlas takes `prison-de-l-abbaye`, which is the first in
`P276` order **and** the item whose point is the event's own `P625` to four
decimals. That is the rule applied without judgement, and it is still a
prison standing for a week of killings in a dozen towns. Nothing is wrong in
the data; it is thin, and it is flagged `a9-place` like every other.

### The nine that name neither an actor nor a place

M67's rule asks that a filed child with no actor line and no place, and a bare
main event, be argued for somewhere a person can read. These are this batch's,
and the reason is the same one in all of them: **Wikidata gives them no
location at all, or only a country**, which is the case deviation 1201 settled
on this branch.

- `atlantic-revolutions` — the bare main event. A revolutionary wave across
  two continents has no point on the ground, and its item names none; the
  Italian Wars and the Thirty Years' War are placeless on this branch for the
  same reason.
- `french-revolution` — `P276` and `P17` are both `Q142` France, a country.
  Placeless until a fire may write a country's point, which is deviation
  1201's line.
- `reign-of-terror` — `P276` is `Q58296`, the French First Republic: a state,
  not a town.
- `fall-of-maximilien-robespierre`, `flight-to-varennes`,
  `insurrection-of-31-may-2-june-1793` and `civil-constitution-of-the-clergy`
  — **these four carry no `P625`, no `P276`, no `P131` and no `P17`**. Their
  items say nothing whatever about where they happened, so they are placeless
  and they carry a lane named for them in `data/imports/wikidata-seeds.json`
  instead, which is what that file is for. The atlas does not take a place out
  of prose, and all four leads name Paris or Varennes in so many words.

### The edges (A5, M72)

Three, all `probable`, each on a lead that states it in so many words, each
citing the article at its revision with a `§ lead` locator and the Wikidata
item beside it:

- `storming-of-the-bastille --caused--> french-revolution` — *"Its fall was
  the flashpoint of the French Revolution"* (revision 1374060912);
- `flight-to-varennes --precondition-of--> champ-de-mars-massacre` — the
  massacre's lead, revision 1370703702, puts the decree *"after Louis and his
  family had unsuccessfully tried to flee France in the Flight to Varennes the
  month before"* and the crowd out against the decree. `precondition-of` and
  not `caused` because the decree stands between them and this atlas does not
  hold it;
- `execution-of-louis-xvi --reacted-to--> insurrection-of-31-may-2-june-1793`
  — *"the representatives in the National Convention, who in January had voted
  against the execution of King Louis XVI and since then had paralyzed the
  convention"* (revision 1370623840).

**The largest connected component did not move, and this batch can say exactly
why.** 517 before and 517 after. The three edges connect five of the new
records to each other and to nothing else, so the vein is an island of five
beside the fourteen that arrived with no edge at all — the same finding
batches 1, 3 and 5 wrote down, and the same reason: the episodes of one
revolution are chronological to each other and their leads argue no causation
between them.

**What would have joined it, and why it is not here.** The one edge that would
have hung the whole cluster on the 517 is
`french-revolution --> haitian-revolution-1791-1804`: the Haitian record's own
summary, written in M50 and citing *"Haitian Revolution"* revision 1375172946,
says Ogé's revolt *"pressed the French revolutionary government into granting
them citizenship in May 1791, and the clashes with the slave owners that
followed destabilised the colony"*. That is this atlas's paraphrase and not the
article, and the article's **lead** does not state the link — so the warrant
would have to come from the article's **body**, which this fire could not
read: `api.php` and the REST `page/html` endpoint answered 429 throughout, as
the fifth fire's note warned they would. **The edge was not written rather
than written on a paraphrase.** It is the first thing the next fire should do
if the rate limit has lifted, and it is worth a fire's first minutes: one
sourced edge moves the component by twenty.

### What was refused, and why

- **`Q207318` French Revolutionary Wars** (58 sitelinks) and **`Q249960`
  Chouannerie** (20) — both run past 1799 (to 1802 and 1800), so neither sits
  inside the umbrella's span. They would each cost a main event and belong to
  a fire that takes the Napoleonic period on purpose.
- **`Q219817` French Directory** and **`Q219825` National Convention** (56 and
  53) — governments, not events; they are actors of this atlas's kind or
  nothing, and no fire has asked for them.
- **`Q370029` the Great Fear** (24) — refused for its class. Its only `P31` is
  `Q3377832` *collective fear*, and that item **carries no description at
  all**. The seeds file's rule is that a class nobody has decided about is
  refused and listed rather than guessed at, and there is nothing here to
  read: deciding it would be deciding from the label alone. **Deviation
  1210.**
- **`Q2622002` abolition of feudalism in France** (20) — refused for the same
  kind of reason and it is worth being precise about. Its only `P31` is
  `Q322732` *abolition*, whose Wikidata description reads *"termination of
  criminal proceedings before its final conclusion or waiving of prosecution
  of a particular category of offences"* — the narrow legal-procedure sense,
  which does not describe the item that carries it. Mapping the class to `law`
  would have been reading the class's **name** and ignoring its gloss, which
  is the guess the table exists to prevent. **Deviation 1211.**

### The class table

Seventeen entries added, each with the gloss read off the class item itself
over the network and quoted in its note. Twelve for the events — `Q104708121`
storming, `Q381045` oath, `Q750215` mass murder, `Q5465517` food riot,
`Q124757` riot, `Q15238777` legislative term, `Q1430466` flight, `Q2571972`
decree, `Q10855380` public execution, `Q204933` decapitation, `Q180684`
conflict and `Q2627975` ceremony — and five for the places the A9 pass needed
before it could write them: `Q40357` prison, `Q16560` palace, `Q19860854`
destroyed building or structure, `Q805248` jeu de paume building and
`Q174782` square.

Four of the twelve take `other`, and that is the table being honest rather
than the run being lazy: an oath, a legislative term, a flight and a
generic conflict are none of the eleven named categories, and
`data/categories.json` says `other` is *"a category the atlas has too few of
to name yet, never a category nobody looked for"*.

**Four items were refused once and imported on the second run.** `Q12989672`,
`Q1192894`, `Q206979` and `Q15784403` name no location of any kind, so no lane
could be derived from a point and the import refused them — the case
`data/imports/wikidata-seeds.json` → `lanes` exists for, and deviation 447 has
been sitting in. Each was given `europe` there, taken back out of the state's
`done` list, and imported. **Deviation 1212**: taking an id out of
`wikidata-state.json`'s `done` after supplying what the refusal asked for is a
re-run of a refusal and not a re-import of a batch, and the brief's *"a batch
already pushed is never re-imported"* is untouched by it.

### One interval closed, from the record's own article (A7)

`civil-constitution-of-the-clergy` arrived with `end: null` and the
`end-unstated` flag, which is A12 C3's corrected rule working as intended:
Wikidata gives it `P580` 12 July 1790 and no `P582`. But `end: null` reads as
*"as far as the data goes"*, and that put the record **outside** the French
Revolution it is part of — `tests/m62.test.mjs` caught it, and it is a real
defect and not a flake. The end is taken from the article the record already
cites, at revision 1370659862, whose first words are *"a law passed on 12 July
1790 during the French Revolution"*: the event is the passing and it ends on
the day it happened, as `slave-trade-act-1807` does. The flag is cleared and
`review.note` says what was changed from what and why, which is A7's shape.
The article also says the schism that followed *"was not fully resolved until
1801"* — that is the schism and not this record. **Deviation 1213.**

### The counts (A10)

Active / main, over the topology the validator builds.

| Europe's 18th century | 1 / 1 | **20 / 2** |
| the `americas` lane | 140 / 59 | 140 / **58** |

*The before column is this branch's head after the two merges at the top of
this fire, not batch 5's numbers.*

**Europe's 18th century is no longer the thinnest cell in the atlas.** It went
from one active event to twenty and from no umbrella to two, and the century
that now trails in this partition is the Americas' 16th and 18th, at three
each.

**The `americas` lane lost a main event and gained no active one.** That is
the Haitian Revolution going under the Atlantic Revolutions, and it is the
only thing this batch did to that lane.

### Deviations

**1210.** `Q370029`, the Great Fear, refused because its only class carries no
description. A class nobody can read is not a class somebody decided about.

**1211.** `Q2622002`, the abolition of feudalism, refused because its only
class's Wikidata description describes something else — the criminal-procedure
sense of *abolition* — and mapping it on the strength of the class's name
would be the guess the table prevents.

**1212.** Four ids taken back out of `wikidata-state.json`'s `done` list after
being given a lane in the seeds file, and imported on a second run of the same
batch. A refusal re-run is not a re-import.

**1213.** `civil-constitution-of-the-clergy`'s unstated end closed at 1790
from its own cited article, under A7, because `end: null` put a child outside
its parent and failed `tests/m62.test.mjs`.

## Where the run stands, for the fire that picks it up

*22 September, after batch 6.*

| | |
| --- | --- |
| corpus | **722 active** |
| **main** | **243** — the count the next batch must not raise |
| **largest connected component** | **517** |
| components | 165 |
| events with no edge at all | 135 |
| Europe before 1900 | 63 active, 17 main |
| the `americas` lane | **140 active, 58 main** |
| the thinnest cells left | the Americas' 16th and 18th (3 each), Europe's 15th (3) |

**What the next fire should weigh, in order:**

- **The Haitian edge first, if the rate limit has lifted.** Batch 6 left
  `french-revolution --> haitian-revolution-1791-1804` unwritten because the
  only warrant it could reach was this atlas's own paraphrase: the article's
  lead does not state the link and `api.php` and the REST `page/html`
  endpoint answered 429 all fire. One sourced edge read off that article's
  body joins a cluster of twenty to the 517, which is the largest single move
  available anywhere in this partition. Try `page/html` before anything else
  and give up on it quickly if it is still 429.
- **`Q1123201`, the Spanish American wars of independence** (1808–1833, 45
  sitelinks), is the best row left and it is free: Wikidata makes it `part of`
  `Q3108868`, the Atlantic Revolutions umbrella batch 6 wrote, so it files
  under an umbrella that already exists and **costs no main event**. Its own
  inverse `part of` vein is the Americas' 19th century, which is the lane and
  century the brief's ordering now points at.
- **The Americas' 16th and 18th centuries are the thinnest cells left**, at
  three active events each, and the 15th is at three too. The 18th has the
  same answer the 19th does — the wars of independence reach back into it
  through the Túpac Amaru and Comunero risings — and the 16th wants the
  Spanish conquest, which is a vein nobody in either lane has touched.
- **North America is still the thin half of the `americas` lane**: 17 active
  against the south's 118, unchanged since batch 4. The brief's ordering has
  been satisfied since batch 2, so a fire may take a North American vein
  whenever the American centuries are the ones that trail — and they are.
- **Europe's 15th and 16th centuries now trail Europe's 17th and 18th**, at 3
  and 6 against 21 and 20. Batches 1, 5 and 6 have taken the 16th, 17th and
  18th; the 15th has no umbrella and the Hundred Years' War ends in 1453,
  which is inside it.
- **`great-depression` and `la-violencia` are still A12's, not this
  branch's.** Unchanged from batch 3's note.
- **`santiago-de-cuba` and `havana` carry no Wikidata item**, and a later
  sweep of `Q117040` or `Q1563` will write a second record for the same town.
  A fire with `--reconcile` should close that gap.
- **The four American centuries before 1800 still have no umbrella** except
  the Atlantic Revolutions, which reaches back only to 1765. Batch 1's
  finding stands: `Q2088324` Colonial Brazil carries no `P580` or `P582`, so
  the tool refuses it.
- **The sixteen undated Colombian actions** batch 3 left are still on the
  table, and still for want of a date in Wikidata rather than a source.
- **The Wikimedia action API is rate-limiting this sandbox harder than it was
  at batch 5.** `Special:EntityData` and `query.wikidata.org/sparql` answered
  normally throughout this fire; the REST `page/summary` endpoint answered for
  the first thirty or so requests and then joined `api.php` and `page/html` in
  429. The import's own lead fetching got all nineteen leads before that
  happened, which is why this batch has nineteen summaries. **A fire should
  spend its early requests on the leads it needs and its later ones on
  nothing.**
