# M42b — the Americas, and Europe before 1900

The second records lane, opened 22 September on the branch `m42b` under
`docs/m42b-brief.md`: M42's brief and its eleven amendments with A11's
partition. **M42 takes Africa and Asia; this run takes the Americas, every
century from 1492, and Europe before 1900.** Deviations number from 1200.

This file is M42's `docs/m42-pool.md` for this lane: the measurement first,
then a section per batch with the main count, the per-lane and per-century
counts, the largest connected component before and after, and what was
refused.

## The measurement, before anything is imported

*22 September, 11:50Z, on `m42b` cut from `origin/m0` at `28978129`. `m42`
stands one batch further on (590 active, 244 main, component 503); nothing of
its batch 34 is here, and the two lanes are measured apart until the assistant
lands them.*

| | |
| --- | --- |
| event records | 819 |
| **active** | **582** |
| **main** (part of no active event) | **245** |
| filed (part of at least one) | 337 |
| active edges | 638 |
| **largest connected component** | **502** |
| components | 59 |
| events with no edge at all | 42 |
| every active event's `review.status` | `draft` |

### Per lane and per century (A10)

Active / main, over the topology the validator builds, so the lanes are the
atlas's own — a record's `region` override first, then the lane its place's
point falls in.

| century | europe | africa | asia | americas | oceania | no lane | all |

### What is this run's, read off that table

**The Americas hold 83 active events against Europe's 303**, and 59 of the 83
are main — the lane is both the thinnest of the four and the least filed, so
nearly every record it has stands alone on the resting timeline.

**Europe before 1900 is thirteen events.** One in the 15th century
(`treaty-of-tordesillas-1494`), one in the 16th
(`hereditary-captaincies-of-brazil-1534`, in Lisbon), one in the 17th
(`royal-african-company`), one in the 18th
(`the-british-industrial-revolution`), and nine in the 19th, of which eight
are main. The brief's *"one to eight main events each"* is exactly what is
here. **Those four cells — Europe's 15th to 18th centuries, one active event
apiece — are the thinnest in the whole atlas**, and the 16th, 17th and 18th
have no umbrella of any kind over them.

**Every pre-1900 record the atlas holds is Atlantic**: the Columbian voyages,
Brazil's cycles of sugar, gold and coffee, the Caribbean sugar islands, the
slave trade and the acts that ended it. There is no continental Europe before
1884 at all, and no North America before 1893.

### South and Central America against North America

The brief orders the `americas` lane *"South and Central America before North
America until they hold as many active events as North America"*. Measured by
the latitude of each event's place, splitting at the Rio Grande's mouth
(25.9°N):

| | active events with a place |
| --- | --- |
| South and Central America, and the Caribbean | **48** |
| North America | **8** |
| in the lane but placeless | 27 |

**The condition the brief sets is already met** — South and Central America
hold six times what North America holds — so the ordering does not bind this
run, and **North America is in fact the thinner half**. The 27 placeless are
mostly South American (Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia) with a handful of
worldwide records that take the lane from an override; A9's place pass is
where they are read.

### What the first batches take, in the order a fire should weigh them

1. **Europe, the 16th century** — one active event, no umbrella.
2. **The Americas, the 16th and 18th centuries** — three each.
3. **Europe, the 17th and 18th centuries** — one each.
4. **The Americas, the 15th and 17th centuries** — four and six, all main.

The main count this run must not raise is **245**, and the component it must
not shrink is **502**.

## Batch 1 — the Italian Wars, and the Greco-Turkish War of 1897

*22 September, the first fire. Taken from the cells that trail most in this
partition: **Europe's 15th to 18th centuries**, one active event apiece and no
umbrella of any kind over the 16th, 17th or 18th; and **Europe's 19th**, where
the atlas held a war with none of its parts.*

**The rule, the same three tests M42's vein uses.** An item enters only if it
is `part of` something this atlas holds or is the umbrella that the cell
lacks; its span must sit inside the parent's at the year; its lane must be
this partition's. Ranked by sitelinks, ties by item id. Nothing was struck or
added by hand except the four refusals below, each for a stated reason.

### What arrived

| the record | sitelinks | filed under | placed at | the edge it earned |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `italian-wars` | 50 | — (the umbrella) | placeless (see deviation 1201) | none |
| `italian-war-of-1521-1526` | 31 | `italian-wars` | placeless (P276 is a country) | none |
| `war-of-the-league-of-cambrai` | 30 | `italian-wars` | placeless (see deviation 1201) | none |
| `italian-war-of-1551-1559` | 23 | `italian-wars` | placeless (P276 is a country) | none |
| `italian-wars-of-1499-1504` | 19 | `italian-wars` | placeless (P276 is a country) | none |
| `battle-of-st-quentin` | 17 | **`italian-war-of-1551-1559`** | `saint-quentin` | none |
| `italian-war-of-1536-1538` | 17 | `italian-wars` | `provence` | none |
| `battle-of-domokos` | — | `greco-turkish-war-of-1897` | `domokos` | none |
| `cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898` | — | **refused, see below** | `crete` | it `--caused-->` the war |
| `battle-of-velestino` | — | `greco-turkish-war-of-1897` | `velestino` | none |

Five place records came with them, each from the `P276` the event's own item
names: `provence` and `crete` at `region` precision, `saint-quentin`,
`domokos` and `velestino` at `city`. A sixth, `italian-peninsula`, was
written and then withdrawn — deviation 1201. The precision is read
off the class Wikidata gives the item — town and commune are settlements,
peninsula and region are not — and the import's own `point` was replaced by
it, which is what A9 asks for and what the import does not yet write.

**`battle-of-st-quentin` went to the nearer parent.** Wikidata files it under
the Italian Wars; its own lead calls it *"a decisive engagement of the Italian
War of 1551–1559"*, and that war is now here and contains 1557. A8 says a
parent already reachable through another parent is not a second parent, so it
has the one.

### The edge

`cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898 --caused--> greco-turkish-war-of-1897`,
`probable`, two locators. The war's lead names the cause — *"Its immediate
cause involved the status of the Ottoman province of Crete"* — and the
revolt's article supplies the other half under "Ottoman intervention": *"On
April 17, 1897, the Ottoman Empire officially declared war on Greece."* The
join between the two is made here and not in either article, which is why it
is `probable`; rule 22 would refuse `consensus` on two Wikipedia citations in
any case. It is the batch's one edge into what was already here, and it is
what moved the component.

### What was refused, and why

- **`Q15542964`, "Italian War of 1542–46 Un penesote"** — the item's English
  label carries what reads as vandalism, and the label is what this atlas
  would print as the title. Refused rather than silently tidied: correcting
  somebody else's label is not this run's to do from a sandbox, and inventing
  a title is not either.
- **`Q14905833` Farsala, `Q12880485` Livadeia, `Q16331940` Voukolies,
  `Q130425867` Pente Pigadia** — four battles of 1897 with no English
  Wikipedia article and a description that reads, in full, "1897 battle".
  The brief's own rule: where the import gives nothing usable the record is
  refused, not furnished.
- **Filing `cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898` under the war** — refused twice over.
  Its span (1897–1898) runs a year past the war's end, and its own lead never
  calls it part of the war; it calls it an insurrection against Ottoman rule
  that the Great Powers settled. The relation between them is causal, so it
  was written as an edge and not as a parent.
- **Filing `berlin-conference` under `scramble-for-africa`** — the one hit the
  `part of` pass over this partition's 40 main events with an item returned,
  and it fails at the year: the conference sat from November 1884, and the
  umbrella this atlas holds begins in 1885. The fix would be to widen the
  umbrella from its own cited article under A7, and `scramble-for-africa` is
  an Africa record and so M42's.
- **`Q2599571` "Crete eyalet" as the revolt's place**, in favour of `Q34374`
  Crete. A9 says the first located thing wins and the eyalet is first, but an
  Ottoman eyalet is a polity, and what ground a polity held is a presence in
  this atlas and never a place. Crete the island is the geography, and its
  point is also what corrected the lane: the import had derived `asia` for the
  revolt from the Ottoman Empire's own point.

**Deviation 1200. The main count rose by two and A6 says a batch that does
that has to say why.** The two are `italian-wars` and
`cretan-revolt-of-1897-1898`, and they are different cases.

The umbrella is the first: Europe's 16th century had one active event and
nothing to file anything under, so the century could not be filled at all
without a top-level record to hang it from — the brief asks for exactly that
(*"write the regional period umbrellas a lane or century lacks"*). It is the
cheap direction of the trade and not the dear one: **ten records arrived and
the resting timeline gained two bars, not ten**. Every further record of the
Italian Wars — and the vein has six more rows already measured — now files
under it for nothing.

The revolt is the second and it is not a trade at all: it is a record whose
sources refuse to make it part of anything this atlas holds, so it stands on
the resting picture with an edge and no parent. That is the honest outcome and
it is what `degree-zero` and the main count are for.

**Deviation 1201. `italian-peninsula` was written as a place and withdrawn
before the fire ended.** A9's rule gave it: the Italian Wars' item names the
Italian Peninsula in `P276` and it carries a point, so a `region` place was
written and two records pointed at it. The map then wrote *"Italian
Peninsula"* across Rome — `tests/map-browser.test.mjs` caught it twice, on the
run's own check and here, and it is a real defect and not a flake: a label
placed at 42°N 14°E is a name written over the middle of Italy.

The fix is in the data and not in the placer, because this run may not touch
the display. **A point that stands for a whole country-sized region is the
case A9 itself holds back**: *"until `M80 done` is on `origin/m0`, an event
whose only located thing is its country stays placeless"*, and M80 is the
milestone that adds the `country` precision and the mark that draws a thing
that large. A peninsula the size of Italy is that case in everything but the
word, so the record was deleted, `Q145694` taken back out of the seeds and the
import's `done` list, and `italian-wars` and `war-of-the-league-of-cambrai`
left placeless in the `europe` lane as the import first wrote them. `provence`
and `crete` are the size of a province and an island and stay. **Five places,
not six; five of the ten events placed, not seven.**

**The batch grew the component by one and left nine records with no edge.**
That is the vein's known cost, measured again: the Italian Wars' phases are
chronological to each other and their leads argue no causation between them,
which is the same finding M42's batch 34 wrote down about the Vietnam War. The
umbrella holds them in the picture; nothing was invented to connect them.

## Batch 2 — the Falklands War, filed and placed

*22 September, the second fire. Taken from the **`americas` lane**, which
batch 1 did not touch and which is the larger half of this partition: 83
active events against Europe's 313, and 59 of the 83 standing alone on the
resting timeline. The cell is the 20th century, where the lane held 43 active
events to Europe's 238.*

**Why the Falklands War and not another vein.** The inverse `part of` sweep
over this partition's 49 items with a Wikidata id returned **164 distinct
items, 161 of them new**, and the largest veins in it are
`colombian-conflict` (41), `falklands-war` (39),
`charter-of-the-united-nations` (25), `cuban-revolution` (16),
`great-depression` (13) and `la-violencia` (10). The Falklands vein was taken
first because **every row of it is dated inside 1982 and the umbrella this
atlas holds is dated 1982**: nothing had to be widened, nothing had to be
refused at the year, and the main count could not move. The Cuban Revolution's
vein was left where it is for the opposite reason — this atlas dates
`cuban-revolution` at 1959 and its battles run from 1953, so taking it means
widening the umbrella under A7 first, and `great-depression` and
`la-violencia` are both on A12's list of spans M42 is re-reading, which is
M42's pass and not this branch's.

### What arrived

Twenty-two events, every one filed under `falklands-war` and every one placed.

| the record | filed under | placed at | precision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `operation-rosary` | `falklands-war` | `stanley` | city |
| `invasion-of-south-georgia` | `falklands-war` | `grytviken` | city |
| `operation-algeciras` | `falklands-war` | `bay-of-gibraltar` | point |
| `operation-paraquet` | `falklands-war` | `south-georgia` | region |

| `mount-kent-skirmish` | `falklands-war` | `mount-kent` | point |
| `skirmish-at-top-malo-house` | `falklands-war` | `mount-simon` | point |

| `battle-of-mount-harriet` | `falklands-war` | `falkland-islands` | region |
| `battle-of-mount-tumbledown` | `falklands-war` | `falkland-islands` | region |
| `battle-of-wireless-ridge` | `falklands-war` | `falkland-islands` | region |
| `operation-keyhole` | `falklands-war` | `thule-island` | region |

### Places (A9)

**Fourteen place records, every one from the first located thing its event's
item names that carries a `P625`** — `P276` in every case here, so the fallback
to `P131` and `P17` was never reached. Seven events took the archipelago
because Wikidata gives their item no location narrower than it: the four ridge
battles above Port Stanley are named hills with their own items, but no item
points its `P276` at them, and **A9 forbids inventing the point that would
place them**.

| precision | places | read off the class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `city` | `stanley`, `goose-green`, `grytviken` | capital city, human settlement, whaling station — settlements |
| `point` | `bay-of-gibraltar`, `san-carlos-water`, `mount-kent`, `mount-simon`, `mount-longdon`, `pleasant-peak` | bay, mountain, hill — a site and not an area |
| `region` | `falkland-islands`, `south-georgia`, `west-falkland`, `pebble-island`, `thule-island` | island and archipelago — larger than a settlement and not a state |

No place took the `country` precision, although **`M80 done` is now on
`origin/m0`** and the precision is available for the first time — nothing in
this batch resolved to a state.

`falkland-islands` is the one that had to be weighed against deviation 1201.
Its item is a territory as well as an archipelago (`Q46395` British Overseas
Territory), and batch 1 refused the Crete eyalet for being a polity. It is
written here as a place all the same, at `region`, because what these battles
need is the island group and that is what the item's own point and description
give: *"archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean"*. It is 250 km across — the
size of Crete, which batch 1 kept, and not the size of the Italian peninsula,
which it withdrew.

**Three places are outside every lane polygon** and carry a hand-written
`region` with the note rule 10 asks for: `grytviken`, `south-georgia` and
`thule-island` sit at 54°S and 59°S, below every region outline the atlas
draws. They take the `americas` lane, which is the lane the Falklands
themselves are in.

### The edges (A5, M72)

Four, each from what an article states in so many words, each `probable` —
rule 22 refuses `consensus` on a Wikipedia citation and none of these joins is
written whole in one source. **Two of the four run into records the atlas
already held**, which is what A5 asks a batch for.

| the edge | into what existed | what the source says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operation-rosary --caused--> falklands-war` | yes | *"The invasion served as a catalyst for the subsequent Falklands War."* |
| `battle-of-mount-tumbledown --caused--> argentine-surrender-in-the-falklands-war` | yes | *"…leading to the fall of Stanley and the surrender of Argentine forces on the islands."* |
| `invasion-of-south-georgia --caused--> operation-paraquet` | within the batch | the seizure of 3 April and the operation *"to recapture the island of South Georgia from Argentine military control"* |
| `operation-sutton --enabled--> battle-of-goose-green` | within the batch | Goose Green was *"within striking distance of San Carlos Water, where the British task force had positioned themselves after their amphibious landing"* |

`operation-rosary --caused--> falklands-war` is an edge from a part to its own
umbrella, and it is written on purpose: `parent` is a display fact that never
enters the adjacency, so the argument that the landing of 2 April set off what
followed has to be carried by the graph or not at all.

### What was refused, and why

- **`operation-sutton --precondition-of--> battle-of-san-carlos`, written and
  then deleted.** Rule 4 caught it: the landing ran 21–23 May and the air
  battle over the anchorage ran 21–25 May, so neither precedes the other. They
  are the same five days seen from the beach and from the air, and the arrow of
  time is right to refuse it.
- **`Q7164` the World Bank and `Q7804` the IMF**, the two largest rows of the
  whole sweep. They are `part of` the Bretton Woods system and they are
  institutions, not events; an actor is what they would be here, and this batch
  is an events batch.
- **`Q155801` FARC**, the largest row of the Colombian vein, for the same
  reason.
- **The twenty-five chapters and preambles of the UN Charter.** A chapter of a
  treaty is a division of a text, not an event, and not one of them carries a
  date.
- **Nine Falklands items with an article in one or two languages and no
  usable span**: two duplicate items for the sinking of HMS Sheffield
  (`Q59559767`, `Q68972231`), `Q68995930` the contested attack on HMS
  Invincible, `Q86083723`, `Q91168260`, `Q84762353`, `Q96638398`,
  `Q19597807` and `Q59640621`. The three "theater of war" items
  (`Q64918028`, `Q64918147`, `Q64995751`) are scopes and not events;
  `Q7097290` Operation Mikado was never executed and carries no date;
  `Q126478242` is an "aspect of history" and not a thing that happened; and
  `Q65114870` and `Q65115220` have no English label at all.
- **An edge from `raid-on-pebble-island` to the landings.** The obvious story
  — the SAS destroyed the aircraft that would have met the beachhead — is not
  in either lead, and this run does not write the edge a source does not state.

### The class table

Seven classes were added to `data/imports/wikidata-seeds.json` → `classes`,
each read off Wikidata rather than guessed, because the import refuses an item
whose class the table does not hold: `Q645883` military operation, `Q1546073`
covert operation, `Q476807` military raid, `Q650711` combat, `Q997267`
skirmish and `Q1303061` friendly fire, all `war`; and `Q744913` aviation
accident, `disaster`. **The Gazelle incident of 6 June carries the last two
at once and so takes no category at all** — `classify()` leaves a category
unset where the table disagrees rather than picking one, which is the right
answer here: an aviation accident is a disaster and friendly fire is war, and
nothing should choose between them on a record nobody has read.

*Two active events carry no start year and fall in no century; batch 1's table
folded them into the 20th, which is why its europe row reads 238 / 66 where
this one reads 238 / 65 and 1 / 1. Nothing moved between them.*

**The main count did not rise.** Twenty-two events arrived and the resting
timeline gained no bar at all: every one of them is inside `falklands-war`,
which was already main and already drawn. This is the trade batch 1 said the
Americas would offer — *"a batch taken there costs nothing in main count"* —
and it is what an umbrella already in the corpus is worth.

**The component grew by two and eighteen records joined it with no edge.**
That is the same finding batch 1 wrote down and M42's batch 34 before it: the
phases of one war are chronological to each other and their leads argue no
causation between them. Two of the four edges reach records that were already
here, which is what moved the number; the other eighteen events are held in
the picture by their parent and nothing was invented to connect them.

**South and Central America against North America**, retaken: 69 active events
with a place south of 25.9°N, 8 north of it, 27 still placeless in the lane.
The brief's ordering still does not bind — the south holds nine times what the
north does — and North America is still the thinner half of the lane by a long
way.

## Where the run stands, for the fire that picks it up

*22 September, after batch 2.*

| | |
| --- | --- |
| corpus | **614 active** |
| **main** | **247** — the count the next batch must not raise |
| **largest connected component** | **505** |
| components | 86 |
| events with no edge at all | 69 |
| the inverse `part of` vein, this partition | **161 rows open**, 22 taken |
| Europe before 1900 | 23 active, 14 main |
| the `americas` lane | **104 active, 59 main** — 83 before batch 2 |

**What the next fire should weigh, in order:**

- **The Colombian vein is the largest one left and it is free of the year
  problem.** `colombian-conflict` runs 1964 to an open end, and its 41 rows —
  the Palace of Justice siege, the false positives scandal, Operation Jaque,
  the Dominican embassy siege, the 2019 Bogotá car bombing — sit inside it.
  Like the Falklands vein it costs nothing in main count, and unlike it the
  records are spread over fifty years rather than eleven weeks, so the lane's
  timeline gains depth and not only bulk.
- **The Cuban Revolution's sixteen rows need A7 first.** This atlas dates
  `cuban-revolution` at 1959 alone; its own article dates it 26 July 1953 to
  1 January 1959, and its battles — Moncada, Alegría de Pío, Santa Clara,
  Yaguajay, Verano — are all inside that. A7 lets a run widen an imported
  interval from the record's own cited article at a named revision. Do that
  first, in its own commit, and the vein files itself.
- **`great-depression` and `la-violencia` are A12's, not this branch's.**
  Both are named in M42's C3 span list, so leave their spans alone here; a
  batch that takes their children before M42 has widened them will file
  children outside their parent.
- **The four American centuries before 1800 still have no umbrella**, and
  batch 1's finding stands: `Q2088324` Colonial Brazil carries no `P580` or
  `P582`, so the tool refuses it and this run does not supply a date. A fire
  wanting those cells needs a period item that carries its own span.
- **Europe's 17th and 18th centuries are still one active event each** — the
  thinnest cells in the atlas — and filling either means writing an umbrella
  first, at batch 1's price.
- **`M80 done` is now on `origin/m0`**, so the `country` precision exists and
  A9's last clause is lifted: an event whose only located thing is its country
  may now be placed. Nothing in batch 2 needed it, but **the 430 placeless
  active events are where it pays**, and the place pass across the whole atlas
  is still open on both branches.
